# How is this solving a real world problem ðŸ¤” 

The Real-Estate Price Tracker aims to solve the problem of uncertainty and lack of transparency in the housing market.

In many cases, homebuyers, sellers, and investors are not aware of the real-time value of properties, which can lead to confusion and missed opportunities.

By providing users with access to up-to-date property data, the Real-Estate Price Tracker can enable them to make more informed decisions about buying, selling, or investing in properties.

This can help to reduce risk and potentially increase returns.

Overall, the Real-Estate Price Tracker is a valuable tool for anyone who is involved in the housing market, as it can provide them with greater transparency and insight into property values.
